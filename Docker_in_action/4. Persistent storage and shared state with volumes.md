## summary

One of the first major hurdles in learning how to use Docker is understanding volumes and the file system. This chapter covers volumes in depth, including the following:

- Volumes allow containers to share files with the host or other containers.

- Volumes are parts of the host file system that Docker mounts into containers at specified locations.

-There are two types of volumes: Docker-managed volumes that are located in the Docker part of the host file system 

 and bind mount volumes that are located anywhere on the host file system.

- Volumes have life cycles that are independent of any specific container,

  but a user can only reference Docker-managed volumes with a container handle.

- The orphan volume problem can make disk space difficult to recover. Use the -v option on docker rm to avoid the problem.

- The volume container pattern is useful for keeping your volumes organized and avoiding the orphan volume problem.

- The data-packed volume container pattern is useful for distributing static content for other containers.

- The polymorphic container pattern is a way to compose minimal functional components and maximize reuse.
